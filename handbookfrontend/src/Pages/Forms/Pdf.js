                  privileges of employment. It supersedes any previous employee
                  handbook, manual or administrative memorandum that you may
                  have received. Changes to the employee handbook that involve

                  will be issued to employees. Changes to the employee handbook

                  fonts, spelling errors) will not be issued to employees.

                  versa. The policies contained herein are intended to stress
                  the values of fair play, courtesy and teamwork. This Employee
                  Handbook is to be used as a working guide for all personnel in
                  the day-to-day work routine. It is anticipated the Employee
                  Handbook will be amended periodically to include new policies
                  and procedures and/or to make policy changes.

                  prohibited, except with the use of a hands-free device and in

                  Telephone communication creates a lasting impression in the
                  mind of the customer as to our professionalism, sensitivity

                  At most office locations, company telephones are equipped with
                  voice mail to record incoming messages for an employee who is
                  absent, away from his or her work area or on another line.
                  Employees must use good judgment when leaving voice mail
                  messages. Messages may not include anything that should not be
                  said in public.

                  The main focus of this social media policy is to provide
                  guidelines for functioning in an electronic world. Social
                  media is a powerful communications tool that has a significant
                  impact on organizational and professional reputations. Privacy

                  Consider what could happen if a post becomes widely known and
                  how that may reflect both on the poster and the Company.
                  Search engines can turn up posts years after they are created,
                  and comments can be forwarded or copied. If you wouldnât say
                  it to your co-worker, customer or Management, consider whether
                  you should post it online. If you are unsure about posting
                  something or responding to a comment, ask management for
                  input. Transparency and honesty are values of the Company and
                  its employees. Posts on social media sites should protect the
                  Company's voice by remaining professional in tone and in good
                  taste. Social media should be broadly understood for purposes

                  Photographs posted on social media sites easily can be

                  Using cellular telephones for tethering as "hotspot" is
                  appropriate for work purposes only. Cellular telephone plans
                  only cover a limited amount of data downloads. If your

                  Deleting or erasing information, documents, or messages
                  maintained on the Company's cellular phone system is, in most

                  electronically recalled or recreated regardless of whether it
                  may have been "deleted" or "erased" by an employee. Because
                  the Company's cellular phone provider has records of all files
                  and messages, files and messages may exist that are thought to
                  have been deleted or erased. Therefore, employees who delete
                  or erase information or messages should not assume that such
                  information or messages are confidential. Even though you may
                  be issued a private password or other private access code to

                  {pdfData.GeneralInformation.companyName} has developed a
                  return-to-work policy. Its purpose is to return workers to
                  employment at the earliest date following any injury or
                  illness. Medical research has shown that people recover more
                  quickly if they remain active and return to their normal
                  routine as soon as possible. This policy applies to all
                  workers and will be followed whenever appropriate. This
                  program does not require the Company to create a position for
                  the sole purpose of accommodating an injured employee.
                  Transitional employment is available based on Company ability
                  to provide temporary modified employment and may not be
                  available in all circumstances.
                  <Break />
                  The Company defines âtransitionalâ work as temporary modified
                  work assignments within the workerâs physical abilities,
                  knowledge, and skills. These temporary assignments are
                  designed to help them remain productive and speed their
                  medical recovery. Where feasible, transitional positions will
                  be made available to injured employees in order to minimize or
                  eliminate time loss. For any business reason, at any time, the
                  Company may elect to change the working shift of any employee
                  based on the business needs of this Company. The physical
                  requirements of transitional/temporary work will be provided
                  to the medical provider. Transitional/temporary positions are
                  then developed with consideration of the workerâs physical
                  abilities, the business needs of the Company, and the
                  availability of transitional work.
                  <Break />
                  The Company will determine appropriate work hours, shifts,
                  duration, and locations of all work assignments. The Company
                  reserves the right to determine the availability,
                  appropriateness, and continuation of all transitional
                  assignments and job offers. If the worker returns to a
                  transitional/temporary job, the worker must make sure that he
                  or she does not go beyond either the duties of the job or the
                  medical providerâs restrictions. If the workerâs restrictions
                  change at any time, he or she must notify the Company at once
                  and give the Company a copy of the new medical status form.
                  <Break />
                  The injured employee must fully understand that transitional
                  assignments are temporary, and part of their rehabilitation
                  program, and that they will be expected to return to their
                  time of injury job as soon as medically released to do so by
                  their treating physician.
                  <Break />
                  If an employee experiences any difficulties while performing
                  their transitional/temporary work, they are to report them to
                  Management immediately. If the employee finds that they cannot
                  work or has to leave work because of difficulties, they MUST
                  report to Management and then immediately see their attending
                  medical provider. The employee must provide an updated medical
                  status form completed by their medical provider, indicating

                  members of the public. "Impairment" or ''being impaired" means
                  that an employee's normal physical or mental abilities, or
                  faculties, while at work have been detrimentally affected by

                  protection of the employee and for safety purposes in case of

                  Anyone who suspects a substance abuse case should discuss the
